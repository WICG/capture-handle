Capture Handle is a mechanism that allows a display-capturing web-application to ergonomically and confidently identify the web-application it is display-capturing (provided that the captured application has opted-in). Such identification allows these two applications to collaborate in interesting ways.

## Explainer

An [explainer document](/identity/explainer.md) is available in the repository and describes the use cases and requirements used to define the API in addition of some optional use cases and requirements that can be discussed with the community.
