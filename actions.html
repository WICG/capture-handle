        This document proposes a mechanism by which an application <var>APP</var> can opt-in to
        exposing certain information with another application <var>CAPTR</var>, if
        <var>CAPTR</var> is screen-capturing the tab in which <var>APP</var> is running.

        <h3>Generic Problem Description</h3>
        <p>
          Consider a web-application, running in one tab, which we’ll name "<var>main_app</var>."
          Assume <var>main_app</var> calls
          <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>
          and the user chooses to share another tab, where an application is running which we’ll
          call "<var>captured_app</var>."
        </p>
        <p>Note that:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><var>main_app</var> does not know what it is capturing.</li>
          <li>
            <var>captured_app</var> does not know that it is being captured; let alone by whom.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Both these traits are desirable for the general case, but there exist legitimate use cases
          where the browser would want to allow applications to opt-in to bridging that gap and
          enable a connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          We wish to enable the legitimate use cases while keeping the general case as it was
          before.

        <h3>Use-case #1: User drives a captured presentation app from a Video Conferencing app</h3>
        <p>
          Consider two applications: a VC app and a presentation
          app. Assume the user is in a VC session. The user starts sharing a presentation. Both
          applications are interested in letting the VC app discover that it is capturing a slides
          session, which application, and even which session, so that the VC application will be
          able to expose controls to the user for flipping through slides. When the user clicks
          those controls, the VC app will be able to send messages to the presentation app (either
          through a standardized API for rudimentary control over any participating presentation,
          or through tight integration over a service worker or a shared back-end infrastructure
          for more sophisticated controls than what is currently standardized). These messages will
          instruct the presentation app to flip through slides, enter/leave presentation-mode, etc.

      <section id="use-case-2">
        <h3>Use-case #2: Analytics</h3>
        <p>
          Capturing applications often wish to gather statistics over what applications their users
          tend to capture. For example, VC applications would like to know how often their users
          share presentation applications from specific providers, Wikipedia, CNN, etc. Gathering
          such information can be used to improve service for the users by introducing new
          collaborations, such as the one described above.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="use-case-3">
        <h3>Use-case #3: Detecting Unintended Captures</h3>
        <p>
          Users sometimes choose to share the wrong tab. Sometimes they switch to sharing the wrong
          tab by clicking the share-this-tab-instead button by mistake. A benevolent application
          could try to protect the user by presenting an in-app dialog for re-confirmation, if they
          believe that the user may have made a mistake.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="use-case-4">
        <h3>Use-case #4: Avoiding "Hall of Mirrors"</h3>
        <p>
          This use-case is a sub-case of #3, but deserves its own section due to its importance. The
          "Hall of Mirrors" effect occurs when users choose to share the tab in which the VC call
          takes place. When detecting self-capture, a VC application can avoid displaying the
          captured stream back to the user, thereby avoiding the dreaded effect.

      <h2>The Capture-Handle Actions Mechanism</h2>
      <p>
        The capture-handle actions mechanism consists of two parts - one on the captured side, one on
        the capturing side.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#captured-side-actions">Captured applications</a> opt-in by registering support for
          standard actions they handle by calling {{MediaDevices/setSupportedCaptureActions}}.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#capturing-side-actions">Capturing applications</a> may trigger these actions using
          {{MediaStreamTrack/sendCaptureAction}}.
        </li>
      </ul>

        There is disagreement on whether actions should be specified here or in a separate document.

        <h3>Captured Side for Actions</h3>
        <p>
          Applications in top-level documents can declare the [=capture actions=]
          they support, if any. They would typically do so before even knowing if
          they are being captured. The intended use is for an application to expect to receive
          these actions from capturer applications wishing to control the progression of
          the captured session, in response to interaction with the user.
          Supported actions are declared by calling {{MediaDevices/setSupportedCaptureActions}}
          with an array of the names of actions the application is prepared to respond to.
        </p>
        <section id="set-supported-capture-actions">
          <h4>Registering and responding to capture actions</h4>
          <p>
            {{MediaDevices}} is extended with a method - {{MediaDevices/setSupportedCaptureActions}} -
            which accepts an array of {{DOMString}}s. By calling this method, an application
            registers with the user agent a set of zero or more [=capture actions=] it wishes to
            respond to.
          </p>
          <p>
            <dfn>Capture actions</dfn> are values defined in {{CaptureAction}}.
            They are meant to be interpreted as instructions from the capturing application to
            control the advancement of the presentation of the captured session, however the
            captured application wishes to define this. The intent is to support capturer
            applications implementing interactive controls for these actions, whose sending
            requires [=transient activation=] and [=consume user activation=].
