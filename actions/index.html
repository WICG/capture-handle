      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This document proposes a mechanism by which an application <var>APP</var> can opt-in to
        exposing certain information with another application <var>CAPTR</var>, if
        <var>CAPTR</var> is screen-capturing the tab in which <var>APP</var> is running.
        It describes a mechanism for <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dfn-browser">tab capture</a> only.

      <h2>Problem Description</h2>
      <section id="problem-desc">
        <h3>Problem Description</h3>
        <p>
          Consider a web-application, running in one tab, which we’ll name "<var>main_app</var>."
          Assume <var>main_app</var> calls
          <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>
          and the user chooses to share another tab, where an application is running which we’ll
          call "<var>captured_app</var>."
        </p>
        <p>Note that:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><var>main_app</var> does not know what it is capturing.</li>
          <li>
            <var>captured_app</var> does not know that it is being captured; let alone by whom.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Both of these traits are desirable in the general case, but there exists specific
          use cases where the user of <var>main_app</var> would benefit if <var>main_app</var>
          had available to it a limited set of standard instructions that <var>captured_app</var>
          has opted into receiving.
        </p>
        <p>
          We wish to enable the specific use cases while keeping the general case as it was
          before.

        <h3>Use-case #1: Driving Presentations from Video Conferencing Apps</h3>
        <p>
          Consider a collaborating presentation software and video-conferencing software. Assume the
          user is in a VC session. The user starts sharing a presentation. Both applications are
          interested in letting the VC app discover that it is capturing a slides session,
          so that the VC application will be able to expose
          controls to the user for flipping through slides. When the user clicks those controls, the
          VC app will be able to send messages to the presentation app, requesting that it do such
          things as flip through slides, etc.

      <h2>The Capture-Handle Actions Mechanism</h2>
      <p>
        The capture-handle actions mechanism consists of two parts - one on the captured side, one on
        the capturing side.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="#captured-side-actions">Captured applications</a> opt-in by registering support for
          standard actions they handle by calling {{MediaDevices/setSupportedCaptureActions}}.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="#capturing-side-actions">Capturing applications</a> may trigger these actions using
          {{MediaStreamTrack/sendCaptureAction}}.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        There is disagreement on whether actions should be specified here or in a separate document.

      <section id="captured-side-actions">
        <h3>Captured Side for Actions</h3>
        <p>
          Applications in top-level documents can declare the [=capture actions=]
          they support, if any. They would typically do so before even knowing if
          they are being captured. The intended use is for an application to expect to receive
          these actions from capturer applications wishing to control the progression of
          the captured session, in response to interaction with the user.
          Supported actions are declared by calling {{MediaDevices/setSupportedCaptureActions}}
          with an array of the names of actions the application is prepared to respond to.
        </p>
        <section id="set-supported-capture-actions">
          <h4>Registering and responding to capture actions</h4>
          <p>
            {{MediaDevices}} is extended with a method - {{MediaDevices/setSupportedCaptureActions}} -
            which accepts an array of {{DOMString}}s. By calling this method, an application
            registers with the user agent a set of zero or more [=capture actions=] it wishes to
            respond to.
          </p>
          <p>
            <dfn>Capture actions</dfn> are values defined in {{CaptureAction}}.
            They are meant to be interpreted as instructions from the capturing application to
            control the advancement of the presentation of the captured session, however the
            captured application wishes to define this. The intent is to support capturer
            applications implementing interactive controls for these actions, whose sending
            requires [=transient activation=] and [=consume user activation=].
          </p>
          <pre class="idl">
            partial interface MediaDevices {
